/// there may be several and returns words tagged with which of them said it. Pointing one
/// microphone at a room and using the first would attribute everyone in it to whoever the
/// source was registered as, so the choice is made per source rather than globally.
///
/// What comes back is a label — <c>Guest-1</c>, <c>Guest-2</c> — that is only meaningful
/// inside this one transcription session and is reassigned the next time one opens. Turning
/// it into a person who is still that person tomorrow is somebody else's job; this class's
/// contribution is the label and the audio it was said in, which is everything that job needs.
